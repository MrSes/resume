# Objective 

I want a job that allows me to use skills I have developed to provide great solutions in a timely fashion for the people I work with. I also want a job that will challenge my technical skills and allow me to further develop those skills and allow me to investigate new technologies that I can then incorporate into my toolkit.

# Introduction

I&#39;m a Software Developer with focus creative solutions to problems and what I like to think of as practicalities of software development (what now seem to be called devops).  I have a lot of experience with a wide variety of languages, technologies/frameworks and industries.  I have a deep interest in solving problems and making those solutions work.

I don&#39;t think the job of a developer is to write code.  A developers job is to deliver quality solution into a production environment. To be an effective developer you need to be involved in all the steps in that process things like working out what to build, how to test the code that implements the solution and ensure that the solution works and that it scales, how to monitor that the solution is working when it is in production, how to get the solution into production, how to update it once it is there with confidence.

Some technical skills I&#39;ve gathered over time: Java, Ruby, Python, C#, PHP, C, C++, Spring, Rails, dotNet Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, Microsoft Sql, systems architectures (monolithic, macro and micro services), problem solutions, Delivery Pipelines, Infrastructure as software, configuration management and effective Communications with humans.
